Main facts about me:

I am:

 - An advanced Git user
 - Unafraid of new technologies

I do:
 - Use modern programming techniques and methodologies
 - Speak UML
 - Write documentation
 - Write clean code (because it is easier to make it efficient when necessary)
 - Always use the most efficient development tools
 - Bring the best from different programming languages
 - Write logs to be analyzed (there's no debugger in production)
 - Know when to stop polishing the code or defer it as technical debt to be addressed later
 - Learn my tools in depth, especially programming languages
